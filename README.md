# Expedia Dataset (using Python)

Python Jupyter Notebook project initially completed July 2017. 

Goal
--------------------
Uses Kaggle dataset to model Regression, Clustering, and Classification algorithms. 

Data
--------------------
Expedia has provided a dataset of customer searches, some of which includes what they searched for (number rooms, number people, dates, location), location where they the search from (site, channel, country where they initiated search), and the result (clicks and whether it resulted in a booking). The goal of the Kaggle Competition is to predict which hotel cluster an Expedia user will book, based on their searching attributes and hotel information. I used the dataset to demonstrate 3 algorithms.

Dataset is available from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/expedia-hotel-recommendations.

Process
--------------------
Part 1 involved exploring the dataset for meaninful patterns using statitical analysis, graphical, and numeric summeries.

Part 2 involved models for Regression, Clustering, and Classification Algorithms. The modeling section is set up so that you can easily manipulate the variables in the model to experiement with different inputs (such as assigning a different target or number of clusters).
